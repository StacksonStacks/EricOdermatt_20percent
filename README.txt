Project description: 

So I want to write a program to help illustrate something we are learning in math.
We recently studied linear programming and were graphically calculating how to gain 
maximum profit (or other things depending on problem) under the given constraints. This
proccess determines how many x items (can change per problem) and y items (can change
per problem) you must produce for maximum profit
The proccess which I'd like to recreate goes like this:
1. Define variables
2. Find *profit equation
3. Find constraint equations
4. Graph constraints
5. Pick a random x and y intercept at whcich to graph your profit line and graph
6. SLide profit line until it intersects with a boundary point
7. Output point (this is how many x things and y things you need to create for max profit)

I will take two variables and constraints for those variables as input in order to graph
the constraint lines. I plan to display output in a new window whith a graph displaying the 
point of maximum profit as well as the maximum profit itself. I would also like to have a sort
of heat map on my graph, where regions of low profit are green and increasing profit regions 
get increasingly red (green -> yellow -> red).

Week 1: Pick project
Week 2: This week I spent a lot of time getting familiar with the ins and outs of gridworld...
and I concluded It probably isn't the best for my project. You suggested proccessing. I've 
invested most of my project time to learning proccessing language. I've started to realize
that this project is potentially beyond my coding capabilites. I don't want to give up and
have decided to take the project in chunks. Next week I want to get the graph done and have
the capabiliy to graph lines.
Week 3: Alright so I just spent a few hours with proccessing. I am not exactly sure what kind
of input proccessing takes but I'll ask you tomorrow, so when I was working on my project I just
commented where I needed it. I managed to get my line graphing capability functional and started
to work on my heatmappper function. This project is doable and I made some definite progress
this week. I haven't been pushing because I saved it somewhere wrong. I'll push everything 
next week. I think I'll be done with the project by week 5. Goal for week 4 is to get input
and heatmapping working
